# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the "K" training examples that are closest to a new data point and makes predictions based on those nearest neighbors.


#How K-Nearest Neighbors Works
## Choose the Number of Neighbors (K): 
K is a user-defined integer that specifies how many neighbors (data points) to consider for making the prediction. A small value of K (e.g., 1 or 3) makes the model sensitive to noise, while a large K value might make the model too smooth.

## Compute Distance: 
For a new data point, KNN calculates the distance between this point and all points in the training dataset. Common distance metrics include:


## Identify Nearest Neighbors: 
After calculating the distances, KNN identifies the K points in the training set that are closest to the new data point.

## Make Prediction:

Classification: The algorithm assigns the class that is most common among the K neighbors (majority vote).
